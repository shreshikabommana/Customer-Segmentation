# Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

This project demonstrates the application of **unsupervised machine learning** to segment customers based on their demographic and spending behaviors. By using the **K-Means clustering algorithm**, the goal is to identify distinct customer groups that can be targeted for marketing and business optimization.

## Key Highlights

- **Unsupervised Learning**: Utilized K-Means clustering to discover customer segments.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and scaled the data to ensure optimal model performance.
- **Visualization**: Visualized customer clusters to understand segment characteristics and behaviors.
- **Model Evaluation**: Analyzed the performance of the clustering model and interpreted the results.


## Dataset

The dataset used is a collection of customer information, including:

- Customer demographics (age, gender, income)
- Spending scores based on customer behaviore valuable for targeted marketing strategies and business decision-making.
